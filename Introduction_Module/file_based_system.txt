Example of Data Redundancy and Isolation:

In a university:
- Registrar keeps a file with student fee payments.
- Professors keep a separate file with student grades.
- Career services keep a file with student placements.

The same student's name, ID, and contact info is stored in all three places,
leading to redundancy. If the student updates their phone number,
each file must be updated separately.
